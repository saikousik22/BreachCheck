# 📘 Email Data Breach Checker

## 🔍 Overview

This project allows users to check if their email address has been involved in any known data breaches using the [XposedOrNot API](https://xposedornot.com/). It offers a user-friendly web interface to enter an email, check for breaches, and display results. It also features a chatbot that helps users understand breach information in **Telugu**, making cybersecurity awareness more inclusive.

## 🧠 Understanding Data Breaches

A **data breach** occurs when unauthorized individuals gain access to private, sensitive, or confidential data. Emails often get leaked in these breaches, exposing login credentials and personal information. This tool checks if your email has appeared in any such breach so you can take necessary security measures.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Check any email address for past data breaches
* 🔢 Display total number of breaches found
* 📋 List all breached platforms clearly
* 🛡️ Show a clean message if no breaches are found
* 🧠 **Built-in Chatbot** that explains breach-related questions in **Telugu** for better accessibility
* 🌐 Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS frontend
* ⚙️ Node.js Express backend for handling logic and API communication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* Git (to clone the repo)

### 📁 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-breach-checker.git
cd email-breach-checker
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### ▶️ Run the Backend

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`

### 🌐 Open the Frontend

Navigate to the `public` folder and open `index.html` directly in your browser.

---

## 🔌 Frontend-Backend Connection

Make sure the API call inside your frontend JavaScript (`script.js`) correctly points to your backend:

```js
fetch('http://localhost:5000/checkBreach', {
  method: 'POST',
  ...
});
```

If deployed to a server (e.g., Render, Vercel), update the URL accordingly.

---

## 💬 Chatbot (Telugu Support)

To make cybersecurity accessible to non-English speakers, the integrated chatbot answers user queries about data breaches in **Telugu**. You can ask:

* నా ఈమెయిల్ ఎక్కడ breach అయిందో చెప్పండి?
* breach అంటే ఏమిటి?
* నేను ఏం చేయాలి?

It improves usability and ensures better awareness for regional users.
